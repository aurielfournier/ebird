Andy Johnson said he had one at the sedge meadow just before (Northern Center wise) the polar sign with the wildlife management area in the sedge marsh there. After two unfruitful visits, he told me what part of the marsh he had heard it in, and I parked and tapped there this time.  <br />Submitted from BirdLog NA for iOS, version 1.5.2	Came right out along the water's edge. I watched it for about a minute, before it swam halfway towards me (the tapping call) but got uncomfortable with the human near 'the intruder' and swam back and disappeared in the  sedge. I left shortly afterward. Awesome lifer experience! Beautiful bird! Unfortunately, it was low light and I didn't know how to compensate. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/82497185@N08/9441910574/" title="Yellow Rail by NatureThroughNorthernEyes, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5549/9441910574_0f446acd08.jpg" alt="Yellow Rail" /></a>	obsr276175	Reid	Hildebrandt	S14604709	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD	12			1	0		1	0

I was walking through the vegetation back to the boat ramp( 800m NE) I heard a "Squeak" less than 3 m in front of me.. Not knowing what made the sound I put down my gear. I quickly moved forward to find what made the squeak.  A few more metres away from where I heard it first was another squeak. I quickly moved to that location and flushed up the rail. The rail flew just above the vegetation maybe 6m and disappeared into the grasses/sedges. I could not find or hear the rail once it landed.  This is the first time I have heard this species vocalize something other than its "clicking". According to the Birds of North America Yellow Rail account  "Squeaks, almost always given by a retreating bird"	obsr144852	Tyler L.

We got Don Sutherland, Ron RIdout and Stu Mackenzie loaded up before they headed out.  The helicopter ride was quite nice with sunny skies.  It took about an hour and we saw 5 bears and 2 flocks of AWPE.  After unpacking a bit of gear we grabbed our packs and scopes and headed out to the coast since high tide was at 1230.  We weren't disappointed even though it wasn't as spectacular as some previous days.  After the flight was mostly done a PEFA showed up to the north and chased a flock of about 15000 peeps past us!	heard ticking just SE of camp	obsr114786	Mike V.A.

We heard 3 counter-vocalizing Yellow Rail and captured one from the marsh after luring it in with the clicking of two coins and throwing a dip net over it.  The bird was banded, photographed and seen well by the entire group.  Le Conte's Sparrows were vocalizing through the entire night as we explored the marsh, all around us.  The count is a conservative estimate of birds vocalizing in the dark.		obsr16653	Benjamin 	Clock	S2261768	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	120	.805		10	1		1	1

À notre surprise, il vocalisait encore (mais beaucoup moins fort que la veille, peut-être parce qu'il ventait plus ce soir-là) dans le même secteur que la veille, Nous avons encore suivi les sons qui se déplaçaient mais sans voir l'oiseau, que nous savons très furtif. Un peu plus loin, nous avons eu la surprise d'entendre un second oiseau qui vocalisait en se déplaçant dans les herbes. Ce dernier semble bien s'être aventuré accidentellement sur le territoire d'un couple de Marouettes de Caroline car nous avons soudain entendu les cris plutôt agressifs de cette espèce.	obsr108682	Evelyne	Samson	S10094438	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD_CAN	120			1	1		1	0

Alors que je prêtais l'oreille pour entendre un Bruant de Nelson, j'ai soudain entendu des sons étranges (comme deux cailloux qu'ont frappait ensemble, donnant une sorte de message en Morse: tic-tic, tic-tic-tic...), que j'avais déjà entendus, il y a bien longtemps. Vérifiant autour de moi que rien ne pouvait produire des sons semblables, j'ai fait signe à André de me rejoindre et lui ai dit, toute heureuse, qu'un Râle jaune vocalisait dans le champ. Nous nous sommes rapprochés de l'endroit d'ou venaient les sons et nous avons pu suivre pendant une bonne vingtaine de minutes les déplacements d'un Râle jaune sous le couvert végétal. Nous aurions bien aimé revoir l'oiseau que nous avions entendu et vu, par hasard, au printemps 1993 (je crois), à l'Ile de la Commune de Berthier. Mais, comme c'est une espèce menacée, nous ne l'avons surtout pas appelée pour ne pas la déranger, ni lui nuire d'aucune façon. Nous qui pensions ne plus jamais revoir ou entendre cette espèce, avons été enchantés de le savoir près de nous, ce soir-là. --	obsr108682	Evelyne	Samson	S5246929	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD_CAN	150			2	1		1	0

Following several days of rain.	First seen swimming from a flooded out area to a dense patch/ island of vegetation.  Swimming profile, very low in the water and not easily seen, not seen by others at this point,  Bright yellowish supercillium over dark face and ear patch, short thick bill, and blackish back, with yellow stripe.  Disappeared in dense veg. to be picked out ~ 30 min. later by Rich Stallcup clinging to the bottom branches of the largest and one of the few bushed remaining above the tide in this veg patch.  At this point observed with great views through scopes at distance of ~ 100 feet.  Notes: " clinging to the base of partially submerged vegetation at and slightly above water level.  Most obvious was yellow supercillium, over dark brown face/ear patch through eyeline.  Dark face stood out against the buffy-yellow lower face/cheek, breast, throat, and eye-brow.  Noticibly small sized with short bill, stouter than Black Rail.  Back and crown dark, overall blackish.  The back had distinct yellow-buff stripes running down back and narrow white feather edgings giving a subtle, scaled look, but really far more black than any other color.  Crown black with very fine white spotting (only visible with these great scope views).  Underparts buffy yellow with whitish lower belly that was only briefly seen, tended to hunker down dipping lower belly into water.    Bill non-descript greenish-grayish with a paler base upper and lower.  While good cover from above, we had good visibility from across channel and below top.  It kept a low profile, partially submerged, and dipped even lower when California Gull or Harrier would fly over.	obsr230086	Bill	Shelmerdine	S12195493	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD	690			5	0		1	1

At this no longer accessible location, you needed a winter tide 7.0 feet or higher (at the Golden Gate), and to be there at least one hour before high tide. Waldo's Dike was located along Sir Francis Drake Blvd, .1 mile west (northwest?) past Drakes View Blvd, between Inverness and Inverness Park.	1 in scope for over an hour. Bill saw it swim out to some tall, flooded vegetation, then as the tide dropped, the bird became visible.

While I have checked this "yes" as a complete list - for reasons I will explain below - the obvious gaps on this list (only one species of gull, no blackbirds or finches) show me how much eBird has helped me improve as a birder, by noticing everything in my environment. What ensures me that I was doing the best I could is that I was always trying to build good day lists, and would be unlikely to leave off anything I had positively IDed, and I had just begun keeping track of my county birds at the end of 2004. But still - no Anna's Hummingbird? no Cormorants?	This is one of the most painful sightings of my life. The bird had been captured by a Great Blue Heron when someone called out the ID. I saw the bird as its captor spread-eagled the victim's wings - saw the white patches...but I just can't count this as my life-sighting. Wrenches me even now, 8 years later, to think of it. Not on my life list.	obsr91229	Jennifer	Rycenga	S10123352	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD	130			2	1		1	1

As I wrote in my journal at the time, a 7-plus tide was expected around 9 a.m., and the previous few days had been stormy. When I arrived, I found a couple dozen birders at the dike. Once standing on the dike and looking north, I recognized that this was the area where Charlie and I kayaked when we stayed nearby for his birthday in 2003. One after another, the BLRA flew as their habitat became flooded. An egret, then a heron--and then a PEFA nabbed rails. One came up right onto the dike before disappearing. A bird that looks overall black at a distance is dark gray with a bit of rufous on the neck and delicate white stippling on the back. I was standing near some dense fennel not far from Rich Stallcup when he called out "Yellow Rail." I looked down and there it was. I immediately got out of the way, fearing a stampede of birders. Other bonuses were a Sharp-tailed Sparrow and a long-tailed weasel, which jumped onto the dike, stared at me, and then leapt into the pasture. Despite the great sightings, I came away feeling that birders should not be allowed on the dike when the birds are so vulnerable. I was glad to read later that the access would probably be limited.		obsr172295	Judith	Dunham	S5581570	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD	90			1	1		1	1

Pale, horn-ivory bill and black face mask. No rufous and small copared to Sora. We were watching Black Rails and this slightly larger bird flew past our view. thew white secondaries caught our attention immediately, but it was too amazing to believe. We watched where it landed and literally crawled to see if we could see it again. On our hands and knees we crept. We eventually stood back up, and found the bird a few feet away from us.  In shape, much like Sora or Black Rail¿compact and short-billed. This bird appeared much like a Savannah Sparrow oddly, but with long legs. In flight, the white secondaries were obvious. It flushed from our feet and flew across the water where we observed it in flight for several seconds. This was the perfect situation to find such a bird. High tide, heavy storm brought rains the night before. Water levels were extremely high.	obsr8586	Matthew	Dodder	S15432194	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD	240			2	0		1	1

After an extended period of time checking the hayfields and marsh along County Road 38, we looked for a Least Flycatcher that had been heard and seen briefly along a willow riparian corridor that crossed County Road 35 about 0.75 km south of County Road 38.  We next wandered a bit around the community, checking the northern part of County Road 35 and trying to track down Jessee Harris, the owner of the field with the rail (which involved a second visit to the Eagleville area mid-day; 12:05-12:30 pm).  In addition to the open fields and marshes east of town, and the riparian corridor to the southeast, we also checked ranch yards, scattered trees and fields along the various roads, and a large pond or small lake along the Surprise Valley Road about 4.5 km north of town.  Larry and I returned late in the day in the hope of recording and seeing the Yellow Rail, so we spent an extended period of time in the field north of County Road 38, where I recorded the bird calling late in the day and then we tried, largely unsuccessfully, to see it after dark (6:05-10:55 pm).  We were joined in the morning by five other birders from various areas in northern California.  It was clear all day, and initially calm or nearly so, but with a mild (5-10 knot) breeze from the north picking in the afternoon.  Temperatures seemed to range from the low 50s to a peak in the low 80s before dropping late in the day and after dark.  6:05-10:45 am, 12:05-12:30 pm, and 6:05-10:55 pm.----Mule Deer - 2;--Belding's Ground-Squirrel - 10 (these were in a grassy low spot near the pond along the Surprise Valley Road about 4.5 km north of Eagleville).	We spent an extended period of time trying to record and see a bird found the previous day by Steve Rottenborn 0.7 mi. east of County Road 35 and about 300 meters north of County Road 38.  Although this bird sang consistently at dawn, it sang more intermittently late in the day and even less after dark.  I was able to get some good recordings of natural song, and with some effort we managed to bring the bird in quite close to us, but we never saw it clearly.  I was the only one to see it at all, and all I saw was a small round bird with a short neck and a small head, from which projected a relatively short bill that tapered from a heavy base to a blunt tip.  The body seemed to be about the size of a softball and the tail was quite short.  When the bird exploded up from the grass about 2 ft. from me the sound of the wings was almost quail-like.  I could have identified the bird as either a Yellow Rail or a Sora on the basis of what I saw, but the only bird calling this close to us was a Yellow Rail.	obsr54638	Curtis	Marantz	S8515700	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	595	10		3	1		1	1

Much as before, we drove about 0.7 mi. east of County Road 35 and then walked about 300 meters north into the field to the same place where Larry and I had tried to see the bird the previous evening.  We tried to arrive as early as possible, but we nevertheless had only a narrow window before it was too light for us to have much of a chance of the bird coming into the open.  As such, we again heard the bird at close range and I finally managed to get a good recording of it singing, but we never did see this bird.  Although I heard many of the birds we had encountered here the previous day, we left the site shortly after light, and as such, we did not see most of the birds that were present.

L864401	H	40.4055637	-121.3618362	2010-06-26	10:00:00	with Lucas Gaede	Encounter--On 26 June 2010, I hiked to the backside of Willow Lake along the trail leading northwest from the campground. At 1215 hrs, while stopping along this trail and looking out over the marsh, I heard the distinctive calls of a Yellow Rail coming from the dense marsh vegetation within 10 meters. I listened to the calls being given intermittently by the bird for about an hour before continuing departing the area. ----I also heard the bird calling spontaneously from the same area the following morning (6/27), at 0657 hrs. It continued calling for about an hour. During this time, I heard a distant calling Yellow Rail, one that I am relatively certain was a second individual. I never heard both at once, but the distant bird called between the series of calls given by the closer bird, and there was no way it could have been the same individual traveling this distance and back in this short time. On the way out, I met Frances Oliver who was on the way in, and I gave her detailed directions to where the bird was calling. She also mentioned in a later e-mail to me that she heard two birds (and possibly three).----Description--The calls of the Yellow Rail were given in a series of two and threes, in a “tick–tick, tick-tick-tick” fashion as has been accurately described by others as sounding like two stones being repeatedly tapped together. This Yellow Rail called spontaneously during each visit, and seemed extremely long-winded. Both Virginia Rail and Sora were also heard at various locations in the same general area. The “ticking” calls of the Yellow Rail were distinctive, and unmistakable at close range.	obsr221434	Peter	Gaede	S19517473	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	255	4.023		2	1		1	0

Coming from wet grassy marshy area along edge of lake. Same place as reported by others. While it was calling (about 50m away) another was faintly heard calling on the other side of the marsh (over 250 m away), the calls seemed to be overlapping so seems to definitely be two birds.

L864401	H	40.4055637	-121.3618362	2010-07-19	16:00:00	The purpose of this visit was to witness the Yellow Rail observed here over the past 3 weeks. No observations had been published this week so Ken Burton and I were not certain the bird was still being heard. I didn''t see Jeff Seay''s 7/17/10 post until I returned.  We walked the trail to the noted location, about 200 meters beyond the north edge of open water to a point where a couple of crossed sticks were located next to the trail. We arrived at the X about 1630 hrs and immediately heard the nearby bird, about 20 meters away, estimated by triangulation of the sound.  We spent 10 minutes here then walked toward the north end of the meadow into Lassen NP then returned to the crossed sticks.  Ken first heard the 2nd bird, much further into the marsh, at least 70 meters away from the first and maybe a little south from perpendicular to the first bird.  Because the near bird was so close, it was difficult to hear the more distant bird until the nearer bird stopped calling.  We both heard both birds calling alternately and together. Definitely 2 birds.	Males? do females call?  both yellow rails were heard simultaneously and consecutively from THE SAME LOCATION. Both were doing a distinctive five note "tick, tick- tick, tick, tick" call.	obsr34879	Chet	Ogan	S6658914	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD_KLAM_SISK	90	.805		2	1	G182361	1	1

From the campground at the end of the road, Howard, Larry and I walked west-northwest a little over a kilometer to an overlook near the end of the marsh, where we found Paul and Barbara, who had been present for about an hour.  We then spent an extended period of time listening to this bird and I returned to our vehicle to retrieve my recording equipment to get a recording.  We looked only superficially at the other birds that were present in the marsh and in the forest that we traversed to arrive at the west end of the marsh, and I did not see any birds at all on the lake itself.  Given my concentration on recording the rail, and having to walk quickly back to the vehicle to get my gear, I did not spend as much time as others looking at the other birds that were present (so I missed several birds and only heard others that were seen by others).  This was a medium-sized lake (about 600 X 250 meters) with extensive marshes at both the eastern and western ends, and coniferous forest on the slopes and to a lesser degree the flats at the edge of the lake.  As I recall, the forests were dominated by Douglas-Fir, but with Ponderosa and Sugar Pines, and probably also some true firs.  The marsh at the western end of the lake had grassy edges but it appeared that the middle was dominated by low (<1 meter-tall) cattails.  To reach the lake from Chester, we took Feather River Drive 0.7 mi to the first fork, where we took a left towards Warner Valley and continued 5.5 miles to another fork, which we also took to the left toward Mineral.  After another 0.4 mi. we turned right on a cryptically-marked dirt road toward Willow Lake (which was another 4.4 miles over a relatively good but somewhat rocky road).  It was clear, with a mild (5-10 knot) breeze that seemed to come mostly from the west, though it was also variable in both its direction and intensity.  Temperatures seemed to drop from the low 80s to the mid-70s during our visit.  4:30-7:20 pm.	A continuing bird found by Peter Gaedes last week.

Hopped into median and began hunting beetles in the native plantings.	I was surprised by a little Yellow Rail this morning in the parking lot of the Alviso Don Edwards Refuge Nature Center.  It was 9am, Low tide, heavy fog. It actually hopped under my car and hid, which gave me time to go back, open my car and grab my camera. It seemed a little disoriented and had trouble getting up the 7 inch parking lot curbs. The Yellow Rail was calling tick-tick-tick and hopping around the California Fuchsia plantings in the parking lot median. It caught a beetle in the leaf litter and bobbed in and out of the brush. I looked it up when I got home and saw it was rare for our area. I was told by a biologist at the Refuge that this is a new bird for the list.

We visually search for the black rail at night using spotlights, and capture the bird with large hand nets.  During the night of 30 March 2009, we captured two yellow rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis) within the dense Scirpus or Bolboschoenus vegetation (Figure 1).  ----Yellow rails are considered a California Bird Species of Special Concern, Priority 2 (Shuford and Gardali 2008) and a winter visitor in the Suisun Marsh region from October to mid-April. There have only been two previous captures of yellow rail in the Suisun Marsh, from 10 January to 12 February 2002, and two single observations on 11 and 17 December 2002 (Shuford and Gardali 2008).  Little is known about the winter requirements of yellow rails (Bookhout 1995).    ----One yellow rail was an adult female (based on plumage and bill color; Figure 3, 4), and the other may have been a juvenile ("second year", based on plumage characteristics) of unknown sex (Figure 2; Pyle 2009).  Both birds were caught between 2100 and 2130hrs.  ----Though several black rails were heard calling from the same area we have not captured any California black rail at Rush Ranch.----REFERENCES:--Bookhout, T.A. 1995.

About 50 yards off the trail. The specific latitude longitude of the observation is: 41.337068, -71.863831----Date of Observation: 11/17/2013----Time: Approximately 12:00pm, viewed for about 5 seconds----Dates of Occurrence: 11/17/2013, other birders were unable to find the bird----Weather: Overcast, with a light southwest wind.----Distance: When the bird first flushed, I was no more than 2-3 feet from the bird. It came up to my left, not far from my left foot and flew across me to the right and about 20-30 feet further away from me.----Optics: Swarovski 8.5x42 ELs----Field Notes (written on my phone and submitted to eBird, about 30 minutes after seeing the bird): Flushed from saltmarsh. A small bird that I first thought was a large sparrow, flew up about two feet to my left as I was walking out in the salt marsh. As soon as I saw the rectangular white inner secondaries, I got my bins on the bird. Dark wings with rectangular bright white feather pattern that formed the innermost secondaries. Streaked dark and pale mantle. In the bins, I saw a short, stubby kind of triangular bill that wasn't brightly colored, but more dull brown, on patterned dark and light head, with a streaky neck. No view of the feet or much of the undersides, maybe some dark on yellowish breast streaking, but uncertain. Possibly a juvenile, due to more mottled, streaky appearance to head, less strongly patterned than an adult should be, and a not bright yellow bill. Total viewing time was about five seconds. Bird flew maybe 20-30 feet ahead of me and landed. Having close range, diagnostic views, I elected not to pursue the bird any further.----Discussion on the identification. The only other field quality that I¿d like to report (about 8 hours after the observations) was that the size and structure were that of small rail. Chunky, round body with a stout, short round head. The pattern of rectangular bright white inner secondaries on dark wings is diagnostic among all rails, eliminating Clapper, King, Virginia, and Black. Further, the pattern of the mantle and head with a small short, stubby bill makes it unique among similar rails, such as Black Rail, which would be all dark across the entire upperparts. The most similar species would be Corn Crake, which was eliminated by size (this bird was smaller ¿ compared to my shoe), the presence dark wings, not rufous wings, and the presence of white inner secondaries on this bird.----State previous experience: I have heard this bird multiple times in both Minnesota and Michigan, but I have never seen the species. I have handled specimens at the University of Minnesota and have seen a mounted specimen at Harvard.----State previous experience: I have seen Clapper, King, and Virginia Rail many times throughout the United States. I have not seen a Black Rail, despite having heard it within feet of me.----Other observers: None.----Was the bird photographed? No. No time and not pursued.----Phone: 906-370-7582.----Report written: 11/17/2013 at 8pm.----See attached field sketch, drawn at 7pm the day of the observation, about 7 hours later. As noted on the field sketch, I have no memory of the appearance of the tail or feet, as I was focused on the head during my viewing time.----<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/the_skua/10916560246" title="Sketch of Yellow Rail seen at Barn Island WMA, Stonington, CT - 2013-11-17 by Tom Auer, on Flickr"><img src="//farm4.staticflickr.com/3675/10916560246_0074f76e05.jpg" alt="Sketch of Yellow Rail seen at Barn Island WMA, Stonington, CT - 2013-11-17" /></a>	obsr19006	Tom	Auer	S15691720	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	85	4.184		1	1		1	1

Me, Ralph Bird.	At about 1100 hours I saw a Yellow Rail along Blackpoint Wildlife Drive about 1/3 way from Stop 10 to Stop 11 [now Stops 11 and 12], or a mile (on the drive) from the Allan D. Cruikshank Memorial Trail.  the habitat was wet and grassy with several islands of grass.  I saw the bird fly from one island to another about 30m away.  It was almost 15m off the left side of the dike. [in T-10-K, an area of tidal marsh that has been reconnected to the Indian River Lagoon by removal of the entire mosquito control dike.]--Size:  about the size of a Sora, in flight.--Actions:  It kind of flew and jumped across the water to the next island.--Wings:  The basis of this identification was on the white patched on the secondaries proximal to the body.  They reminded me of a White-winged dove.----Doug Stuckey (et. al.) saw a Yellow Rail just past Cruikshank Trail and another person reported to me a Yellow Rail just past Cruikshank Trail a few winters back.  This seems to be a good area for Yellow Rails and other rails, too.--This bird was very late.  Lateness seems to be the trend among wintering birds this year.	obsr115524	David	Simpson	S5453436	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD	120			2	1		1	1

Historic Record - Steve Nesbitt and I saw this bird for about 3 seconds. It flushed from the Black Rush and fluttered immediately back down. The wings were rounded. The legs were light and were hanging down, rail like. The underparts were yellowish and the back was a little darker. I saw white in the wing but did not see the shape of the white part but Steve did and it was a white secondary speculum. I have no doubt about the sighting.	obsr28523	John	Hintermister	S9450320	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD				2	1		1	1

Tylan setup a net and successfully flushed the rail into it. Tylan then radioed other environmental techs and several of us raced out there; I borrowed a camera from Bubba ____. The roll of slide film was then developed and I was given one slide to keep. I heard several years later that the other slides were thought to have been lost. A scan of "my" slide was published in American Birds (52:140, 1998), and I have a digital scan of the slide (and maybe also the slide) in my possession.	Captured by Tylan Dean in a mist-net and held for ~20 minutes until others arrived; I borrowed a camera and shot a roll of slide file; one image was published in American Birds (52:140, 1998).	obsr296335	Bill	Pranty	S19083596	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD				5	0		1	1

It flew low about forty paces straight south from the<br />trail. The brownish bird showed a very prominent broad white trailing<br />edge to the wings before it disappeared down into the tall grass. We did<br />not attempt to reflush the bird. The size, behavior, habitat and white<br />wing patches were perfect for a yellow rail as was the classic brief view.<br /><br />The bird was essentially on the edge of the paved trail right next to the<br />visitor center halfway between the visitor center flagpoles and the first<br />wooden info kiosk along the prairie trail that leads off to the east. It<br />was perhaps 25 yards from the visitor center at 10:30 am today 9/22.<br />	obsr206222	Carl	Bendorf	S11640110	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	150	3.219		15	1		1	1

Clyne in Nov. 2012: Observed by Ronald E. Goetz (the founding secretary of the Illinois Ornithological Records Committee); documentation on file with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources; record accepted and published in Seasonal Report No. 27: 1980 Fall Migration (Vernon M. Kleen, compiler); Clyne also has a photocopy of the documentation.  The documentation includes a sketch of the wing pattern.  Goetz flushed the Yellow Rail twice from the bank of the lagoon adjacent to Bobolink Meadow, the first time without obtaining diagnostics, but the second time "...the bird was noticed taking flight from an open strip of mud within two feet of the author's shoes.  The second flight was rather protracted, allowing time to observe the bird with 8x 40 binoculars before it landed in foot-high weeds 50 feet east of the bank."  Time of sighting was about 15:45, and Goetz wrote down field notes at 18:00 on the day of observation.  Following notes extracted from documentation: "Wings in flight were darkish, with flashy white areas in the secondaries....  During the five seconds (or less) that the bird was viewed with binoculars, the ochre face with dark auricular patch was distinctly observed....  The tiny bill was noted under binoculars."	obsr291090	Jackson Park	Data	S12135193	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD				1	0		1	1

Small, compact rail, flew (point against) low across the path approximately 10 feet in front of me. Bright buffy/golden underparts, with same color running up onto the face. The bird was close enough to see that it lacked the long, orange bill of a VIRA, and it's too early for juv. Sora. It was west of my location, so the sun was nearly directly behind me; lighting was about as close to ideal as it gets (~6:15am).	obsr323963	Matthew	Wistrand	S17951253	eBird - Exhaustive Area Count	EBIRD	378		404.6856	1	1		1	1

Bird flushed right around sunset from a few yards in front of me at edge of marsh, flew past me surprisingly fast & far.  First saw small, SORA-like bird - sora being a bird which I have become increasingly familiar with in my hunt for YERA and ammodramus sparrows - but got bins focused in time to see a small head with a broad, yellowish-orangeish stripe above the eye and a yellowish conical bill.  As it banked right, saw shocking flash of white in wings from behind.  Always wondered if it would be noticeable enough to separate juv SORA.  Guess I got my answer!  The only way I can describe the white patches was blinding.  Tried in a shaken blur to snap pics before it dropped down but unsuccessful.  Walked the edge one last time but no sign of it before I lost light completely.	obsr233021	Andrew S.	Aldrich	S15415870	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	115	2.414		1	1		1	1

First, I kicked up a Sora from shorter marsh vegetation, and it flew over a small patch of open water and hit the cattails at three feet above the water.  Then, I realized it was followed by a second rail.  The second bird was flying toward the base of the cattails.  Its left wing had a small, white area covering most of the secondaries next to the body.  As it was about to crash into the cattails, it banked up to show the right wing which had a white square like the left wing.  It was 15 yds. from me.	obsr60856	Ed	Hopkins	S15396576	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	82	2.092		1	1		1	1

At the east end of the "finger" of water is a small stand of cattails.  As I approached this spot a small tawny colored rail ran out of the vegetation, across a small stretch of open mud and into a dense stand of cattails.   The head and most of the body appeared to be mostly yellow-brown.  I waded into the mud far enough to make the rail fly across a few feet of water into more thick vegetation.  I could see bold yellow stripes on the back and white secondaries.  At this point I returned to the car and called Tom Ewert who lives nearby. He got there quickly and we returned to the spot but were unable to relocate this bird.  Both times I saw the rail the time slot was brief.  I realize that confusion with immature Sora is not impossible, but I believe that this was a Yellow Rail based on the strong yellow striping on the back and the white secondary feathers.  Sora can show some white on the secondaries as well. I've looked at a number of images on the net since I got home and feel that was a Yellow Rail.	obsr281507	Pete	Janzen	S15339601	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	120	1.609		2	0		1	1

Trip involved going south from Oberlin then SW to Roanoke to Thornwell with return through Welsh NE to Oberlin. Saw at least another 1000 ducks in flooded ricefield immediately to east of ricefield next to west side of LA 99 dominated by Green-winged Teal and combination of Dunlin and Long-billed Dowitchers. Some pintails could be seen but the dominant duck appeared to be Green-winged Teal there. Did not notice the Cinnamon Teal referenced by Dan Lane as there was no place to safely view the birds for any sustained period of time. Could not find any hawks other than red-tails. ebird flagged the 300 Cattle Egrets that were feeding in rice fields as rice was harveted during the morning rail search. ebird also flagged the 5 Franklin''s Gulls that were resting in a field on the west side of LA 99 about 1/3 mile north of duck/shorebird concentration. Only found shorebird concentrations in two locations - near Thornwell and north of I-10. 		obsr113070	Jay	Huner	S5507854	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD				1	1		1	0

L527310	P	30.0771901	-92.8455448	2010-11-06	13:30:00	A 2-hr (130-330PM) traveling count at Petitjean Farms off Cherokee Rd., ca. 3.5 mi. SW of Thornwell (Jefferson Davis Parish). Traveled ca. 0.5 mi. by foot. Open semi-flooded rice fields, scrubby roadside edge, and cultivated live oaks, cedars. Second crop rice harvest operation underway. Two combines, <20 acres of rice. Very dry resulting in dust clouds around combines reducing detectability slightly. Relatively low numbers of geese; other waterfowl strangely absent. Waterbirds generally scarce at this location. Good numbers of RTHA hunting fleeing small mammals. Drier-than-usual conditions perhaps more favorable for YERA; above avg. numbers being reported. Surprsingly few shorebirds. BARS still trickling through. High density of SAVS using rice fields. Impressive flocks of RWBL. Fair, 65-66 F, and winds NE at 5 mph.	flushing from combines, most solitary, good count	obsr115384	Devin	Bosler	S7078620	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	120	.402		1	1		1	0

We had a pretty good morning here. Duck nos, especially Blue-winged Teal were downright staggering! I felt BWTE and NOSH counts might have been faintly excessive but not by much. All ducks beside the HOME and WODU early flybys were found fairly heavily sandwiched-in at the northeast end of unit 4, with many standing huddled closely on the banks not far from the woods on the n end. They were very wary and easily flushed. While I've seen fairly large nos of ducks spread across these units in the past few falls, I've never observed this many ducks anywhere in nw La- also literally crammed into such a small area- WOW!!-- Wintering sparrows and wrens, although sp not yet diverse, are moving in. High nos of HOWR, quite a few thrashers and few catbirds. Warblers were low. We found a few other good ones, to boot.	Flushed from tall grass and relocated approx 30' away from tall grass in unit 3.

After a few hours of struggling, I met up with Miah and Meara and we birded together through lunch and until dusk, hitting various thickets in the Low Beach territory (and acouople adjacent territories) and then the Low Beach gulls. We closed at Quaise Marsh, where we scored a lifer for Miah! WEATHER: Cold (35-40 F), overcast, light NW wind after drizzle overnight.	***mega; flushed thrice from marsh. On first flush it flew 30 ft and gave great looks, the second flight was after Tait J. and Nanette had arrived and was about 60 ft, while the final flush was from the cattail edge and sent the bird 100m into the cattail marsh. Low, fluttery flight just above the grass tops with legs trailing behind body. About half the size of Virginia Rails flushed earlier.

The report was followed up by Ryan Johnson and Josh Emm who were able to refind the bird after several hours and obtain photos. After they posted at about 1:30, more people decided to try and by the time I got there at around 4pm - around 10-15 people were present. During this time we walked around the dike, peering hard, hoping...but had no luck. RJ had rejoined us and pointed out the exact location he last had the bird. After about 630, we mostly just congregated here - peering hard into the marsh. ----The bird was heard vocalizing three times between 722 and 734. As soon as it started, 3 or 4 of us immediately said listen/that's it. It was a patterned series of clicks given in twos and threes that were spaced so that the timing intra-set was slightly less than that of between sets. All of us felt fairly confident after the first series that lasted about 45 seconds. The second and third series were shorter and maybe not quite as well defined. In hindsight, the bird may have been farther away and perhaps some clicks just weren't audible. Because of this a little doubt was cast, but I now think this is probably unfounded. ----Recordings - After each time the bird started calling, I hit record using RecForge App on my Android phone. The first set probably took me about 10 seconds to get the phone out and start recording. From this sample, I got a brief 3 second clip where the bird is audible starting 37 seconds into the clip.  That would probably put the whole series at about 45sec to 1min. In this clip (attached below with spectrogram - 4 pairs of doublets are audible). The bird isn't audible on the rest of the first series due to the many other noises in the wetland ~birds/amphibians/ a train. ----<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url&#61;https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/148575865&color&#61;ff5500&auto_play&#61;false&hide_related&#61;false&show_artwork&#61;true"></iframe>----<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pNiIrx5b30XdTQzzd2r9gNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat&#61;directlink">Spec</a>--The second series I estimate at about 30-45 seconds, but I got no usuable recording. The third and final set was maybe 30 seconds. From this I probably got the most convincing recording with a nice 3,2,2 series that is clear with no impeding sounds. This is attached with spectrogram below. ------<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url&#61;https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/148501194&color&#61;ff5500&auto_play&#61;false&hide_related&#61;false&show_artwork&#61;true"></iframe>----<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5_-IIEM_eEy3jG-aW6lMWNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat&#61;directlink">Spec</a>----From the spectrogram on clip 3, you can see a direct comparison with a YeRa recorded in Oregon. Even though this MD bird wasn't doing the repetitive 2/3 2/3, spacing seems to be a match. Here, you can see a pretty consistent spacing of .15-.2 sec between taps intra-set. This matches up with the BNA account that acknowledges some variability (0.1-.25sec). Though the 2/3 2/3 is the most often heard call, multiple sources refer to doublet calls and a triplet/doublet call.  I know of no other imitator that would match YeRa this close. ------Re: Harassment concerns - I was there from 4pm to 830pm and I thought during that time everyone did a nice job minimizing their impact. No one tried walking through the wetland, dragging weighted rope, or almost shredding it with a combine. One person played tape on their own initiative at around 6 but was asked not to do so unannounced. The bird actually called on its own, which was part of the surprise factor. After the bird stopped vocalizing and a few more people showed up, folks did try tape a few times, but it didn't respond and then everyone left.	obsr125277	Jared	Fisher	S18286473	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	278	.805		5	1	G890161	1	1

Mega-rarity for Harford County found earlier this morning by Dave Littlepage, then subsequently photographed by Ryan Johnson. Feel free to invalidate this because I'm not even 100%. We were there for about 2 hours and 45 minutes with no luck and then left to get dinner. While we were gone, I received a text informing me that the bird was calling. We returned and it was silent. I spent a lot of time scanning the area where it was heard and listening intently. I briefly saw two small sparrow-sized birds chase each other. The first bird had obvious white wing patches; the second did not. I'm not sure what else it could have been other than the YERA aside from something partially leucistic, and that just seems far-fetched that a small bird would have symmetrical pure white wing patches in the same spot as a YERA. Soras were in the same patch, but this bird was notably smaller. Other small birds in the patch included MAWR, COYE, and RWBL, none of which have white wing patches. I'm torn about adding this, because I'm not 100% confident and don't want to string it; however, I also don't want to dismiss what could be a very important and noteworthy sighting of an awesome bird. Ultimately I'm leaning towards YERA considering that this bird was 1) small enough, 2) had pure white wing patches, and 3) was in the exact patch where the YERA was heard about 45 minutes prior to this sighting.	obsr263457	Tim	Carney	S18256786	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	278	.805		5	1	G890161	1	1

I visited the park to see the Yellow Rail reported by David Littlepage that morning and later photographed by Ryan Johnson. As many as 15-20 other birders were present during the 4.5 hours I was at the site. Singly and in small groups, we walked the perimeter of the impoundments several times, and waited in the blind and on the trail between the pools before again slowly wandering out to see if we could find the YERA where it had been seen and photographed earlier. Between around 1920-1935, eight to ten of us waiting on the trail between the pools heard, over three separate and distinct periods, series of what most of us identified as a YERA's characteristic "click-click click-click-click" call near the trail through the impoundments. The sound we heard was somewhat difficult to hear over the background noise, but it was clear and distinct and sounded to us very much like recordings of YERA. Jared Fisher (standing next to me) recorded the calls and posted links to several of his recordings in his eBird report. A bit later, probably around 2000, Tim Carney pointed out two smallish birds, one pursuing the other, flying from the same area we had heard the possible YERA. I did not get a good look at the bird being chased, but it was small and appeared to have light patches on its secondaries.	obsr339647	Barry	Marsh	S18273698	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	270	3.219		1	1		1	1

Many folks there at various times throughout.	Heard only in the reedy area south of the main wetland.  Faint, but distinctive clicking in the classic 2 - 3 pattern.  Heard 3 separate times with first time being the longest; about 15-20 seconds maybe.  Other two times were shorter in duration.  It moved about 10 feet or so between the 2nd and 3rd time.

Around 7:20 pm I was in a small group of people facing the emergent phragmites on the opposite side of the trail from the marsh when the rail vocalized. I clearly heard the distinctive clicking for about fifteen seconds. The pattern of the clicks was irregular in comparison with other rails; it was not even, nor did it speed up or slow down. (Whenever I hear a recording of YERA, I am reminded of the sound of an old-fashioned typewriter being used by a somewhat erratic typist, and this matched exactly.) The timbre of the clicks was more hard and percussive than MAWR chips. The rail vocalized a couple more times but it was more difficult to hear and was probably further away. -  Jared Fisher recorded the clicking and included it on his eBird checklist.	obsr131182	Leslie	Starr	S18298526	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD	165			2	1	G892975	1	1

It popped into the air about 8 ft in front of me and I observed it was very small and mostly dark except for buff and black stripes down it's back. I did not need to  view through my binoculars as it was so close.  It had white patches on the back of it's wings at the secondaries.  The sun had just come out from the cloud cover and so the birds head was well lit.  I immediately noted its similar appearance to a goslings head in shape and color with stubby bill, although much smaller. It had a dark streak through its eye. The bird  flew out over the marsh at approximately 4 feet off the ground with its legs dangling and dove back into the reeds when it was 10 yds. out. --I immediately thought Yellow rail as it was very much smaller than the Soras I had already seen and it was not a Black Rail due to head color.  --I posted to google groups my sighting and at least three other birders including Ryan Johnson and Josh Emm traveled to my location.  I gave him a description of the spot where the bird was last seen. They relocated the bird and obtained photos.  All have been submitted to EBird and accepted.	obsr465330	David	Littlepage	S18249645	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	180	.805		1	1		1	1

A large group of us gathered to celebrate Hans Holbrook''s bachelor party, the primary agenda of which was to find Yellow Rail. We''ve long considered this THE weekend to find the species in Maryland, and this year we came prepared to fan out and cover the lower Eastern Shore''s marshes. To our delight, no one need to leave Rumbly Point, as we lucked into these calling birds fairly early in the night.----The first bird was heard by Hans, Tom, and Geraldine at perhaps the 0.6 mile mark (from the woods), but it didn''t call for others (11:20 p.m.). Soon a second was detected at perhaps the 0.9/1.0 by John, Mike Walsh, and me (11:45 p.m.). The entire group hurried here and had decent listens. It would call its 5-note call once or twice and be silent for a couple minutes. Walking north, two more birds were detected that were sufficiently far apart to say we had three separate birds. This was back near the original location, and this is where vocalizations were most regularly heard over the rest of the night. When Matt Hafner arrived, several of us (Stasz, Ron, Matt, and I) had the bird still singing intermittently at 3:15 a.m. Simply awesome. We''ll submit further details to the MD/DCRC.----Heard by others: Common Moorhen, Sora, Indigo Bunting (MH, flyover).----The rare breeding rail will be submitted as a separate report (hidden or at county level). We didn''t want to advertise this location.----Observers: Jim Stasz, Stan Arnold, Ed Boyd, Jim Brighton,  Steve Collins, Tom Feild, Ron Gutberlet, Hans Holbrook, John Hubbell, Bill Hubick, Geraldine King, Mikey Lutmerding, Mike Walsh.

To our delight, no one need to leave Rumbly Point, as we lucked into these calling birds fairly early in the night.----The first bird was heard by Hans, Tom, and Geraldine at perhaps the 0.6 mile mark (from the woods), but it didn''t call for others (11:20 p.m.). Soon a second was detected at perhaps the 0.9/1.0 by John, Mike Walsh, and me (11:45 p.m.). The entire group hurried here and had decent listens. It would call its 5-note call once or twice and be silent for a couple minutes. Walking north, two more birds were detected that were sufficiently far apart to say we had three separate birds. This was back near the original location, and this is where vocalizations were most regularly heard over the rest of the night. When Matt Hafner arrived, several of us (Stasz, Ron, Matt, and I) had the bird still singing intermittently at 3:15 a.m. Simply awesome. We''ll submit further details to the MD/DCRC.----Heard by others: Common Moorhen, Sora, King Rail, Indigo Bunting (MH, flyover).----The rare breeding rail will be submitted as a separate report (hidden or at county level). We didn''t want to advertise this location.----Observers: Jim Stasz, Stan Arnold, Ed Boyd, Jim Brighton,  Steve Collins, Tom Feild, Ron Gutberlet, Hans Holbrook, John Hubbell, Bill Hubick, Geraldine King, Mikey Lutmerding, Mike Walsh.	Heard by all, though not everyone heard all three birds calling. See notes below.	obsr145907	John	Hubbell	S5544258	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	390	2.575		13	1	G104811	1	1

A report will also be prepared and forwarded to the MD/DC Records Committee for their review.  Photographs of the specimen will be included.----Jan showed the flattened specimen to Talbot Bird Club members who had assembled at Black Walnut Point for birding on Oct 17th.  Though the body was flat, the head, wings, and legs were in good condition, and the feathers of back and front of the bird were in good enough condition to make positive identification very easy to attain."--	From Les Roslund: "On October 16, a Yellow Rail specimen was found by Jan Reese near--San Domingo Creek along the south side of St. Michaels in Talbot County.--The bird was on a muddy road side near a bridge that crosses a tributary to--the creek.  There are some fairly low overhead power lines crossing the road--at that point.  Most likely, this bird died from hitting one of the power--lines, and, unfortunately, had been run over by cars before being found.----          The corpse was pretty well flattened, but carried no odor that--would suggest decomposition, so Jan felt the bird had flown to that spot--just a couple of days or so before it was found."	obsr223765	Jan	Reese (Admin: R.

We canoed through the sedge beds of the marsh and played tapes and hit stones together and heard at least 6 Yellow Rails doing the Kik-kik, kik-kik-kik calls that are distinctive.  We saw one briefly skitter away from us into the grass of the marsh and only saw a rail smaller than a Virginia with a scaly black and yellow back.  We did not see the white secondary patch on the wings as it did not fly.	obsr102121	Brian	Allen	S13207738	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	120	4.828		2	0		1	1

I gave Jonathan a call and he showed up about half an hour later, and eventually it piped up again briefly. ----Weather: mostly clear, cold (~35°F--lots of frost on the sedges early on), light wind (maybe about 1 m/sec, picked up substantially by the end).	First heard at 8:11AM--a length burst probably 7-8 seconds long. Then, it gave a shorter (maybe two-second) sequence of calls at 8:15. I called Jonathan and he showed up around 8:45--in the entire meantime, it did not call, and it did not respond when Jonathan played tapes. We tried stomping around, but of course we didn't get lucky and flush it. Finally, at 9:15AM, it gave a very short call sequence--just 3-4 notes--and we left.

Neil G. called me to let me know that he had one calling around 8:15 so I got here as fast as possible. I only heard the rail call off one for about 3 or so seconds around 9:15am. I was not able to wait around much longer because I had to be at church by 10:00am. The bird gave the classic tic-tic tic-tic-tic call of YERA.	obsr161081	Jonathan	Lautenbach	S10516334	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	40	.966		2	1		1	1

I was coming down the side of a cornfield walking in an open wet field of short grasses and other short flora about 15 yards wide and 40 yards long.  Chrissy was on the other side of the wet field walking parallel along another field of corn.    This area was not far from the large water pump near the large white shed.  As I came around the edge of the corn field that opened up into another wet field, a buck flushed and kicked up the rail.  The  rail had white wing patches (white secondaries) as Sibley shows that were solidly white and fanned out into a kind of gray color on the wings. Just as I saw the bird flush, Chrissy did too.   The bird showed a mixed black and yellow colored body.  We both had excellent looks before it dropped back into the grasses.  We tried to refind it for a photo, but could not relocate it where it landed in some tall grasses.  It went from a short grass field to a tall grass field.  We attempted to flush it but nothing would flush in the area it landed.  We kept trying for another hour, but were never able to refind it for a photo op. We originally did not post this on ebird, assuming it would not get approved without a photo.	obsr331538	Andy	Reago	S11801828	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	180	4.828		2	1	G476891	1	1

Approximately 1/4 of the way from the fort to the snack bar.  --Description of encounter: A Least Bittern was calling and moving along beside the boardwalk.  I was slowly moving along watching it when a Green Heron called and flew out of the bent over grasses.  As I watched, the heron flushed a Yellow Rail out of a clump of bent over brown marsh grasses and it flew with legs down parallel to the boardwalk to the right to the next clump.  The distance was about 10 feet  over shallow water and when the bird reached the clump it immediately went into the grasses and did not appear again.    --Description of bird:  The first thing I noticed was the characteristic (buffy) yellow color on the underparts and the face.   I immediately noted the pattern of white feathers and then the dark and buffy streaks on the back as it vanished from sight. Very small with short tail and bill.  Smaller than the Sora's walking on top of the grasses and swimming in open water on the other side of the boardwalk.--My experience with Yellow Rails:--2009 - Rice and Yellow Rails Festival, Thornwell Rice Fields- 3 --West Ship Island - 1--TX  Anahauc Rail Rope Pull, 2013- 3 Yellow Rails, 1 Black Rail	obsr193342	olivia	graves	S18186649	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	260	1.609		2	1		1	1

The habitat visited during this trip was wet pine savanna.  These observation were made while conducting nocturnal drag-line surveys for wintering Yellow Rails.	All five observers observed this individual at about 2-3 meters and for about 30 secs as the bird flew away.  The bird was observed in a high powered spotlight as it flew away from the group.  As the bird flew away from us, the body appeared yellowish brown, had dark, short rounded wings with white patches on the secondaries.  The bird flew weakly although it did fly 100+ meters from us and landed/disappeared into the herbaceous vegetation.	obsr354232	Kelly	Morris	S17816871	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	90	4.828		5	1	G771731	1	1

A possible third bird was flushed first but only seen by 2 group members.  The first bird that I saw flushed at approx. 11 AM, and I saw the bird in flight as it descended back into marsh grass; the flashing white secondaries and small size were distinctive.  The second bird flushed at approx. 12 PM and all 11 group members had excellent views as the bird actually flew above the marsh 2x and was in view for a couple of seconds.  I was able to note the following field characters on this bird: buffy face, small and pale bill, flashing white secondaries, and dark upperparts with speckling pattern and buffy stripes.	obsr118406	Nicholas	Flanders	S9544798	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	460	2.414		8	1		1	1

This was our Yellow Rail outing, where we dragged the marsh with a long rope weighted with bottles filled with gravel in order to flush YERA. Many sparrows, wrens, and a few other rails were scared up as we were walking through the marsh as well. About 50-65 F. Calm, becoming somewhat windy about 11:00. Clear skies.	3 birds flushed total, I saw two of them. Great unobstructed looks at both, several seconds in flight at very close range. White wing patches obvious, and I was able to really great looks at the head and bill as well. The last bird we flushed I was within six inches of me at one point, and the only way to get a better look at a Yellow Rail would probably have to be to have the bird in hand.	obsr119760	Mike	McCloy	S9406505	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	390	4.828		8	1	G327704	1	1

We were joined by John Fussell, Matt Gould and Dick (last name?) late morning. This was our Yellow Rail outing, where we dragged the marsh with a long rope weighted with bottles filled with gravel in order to flush YERA. Many sparrows, wrens, and a few other rails were scared up as we were walking through the marsh as well. About 50-65 F. Calm, becoming somewhat windy about 11:00. Clear skies.	3 birds flushed total, I saw two of them. Great unobstructed looks at both, several seconds in flight at very close range. White wing patches obvious, and I was able to really great looks at the head and bill as well. The last bird we flushed I was within six inches of me at one point, and the only way to get a better look at a Yellow Rail would probably have to be to have the bird in hand.	obsr239617	Jacob	Socolar	S15020807	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	390	4.828		8	1	G327704	1	1

This bird (second individual) flushed from short marsh grass (distichlis and spartina) and made a short flight (almost hovered at one point) before dropping into marsh. It immediately flushed again and dropped into taller marsh grass. Overall golden plumage color (gray and white speckling to feathers too) and small white patches in secondary feathers was viewed well, as well as short bill. Rail was viewed from less than 10 feet. Much lighter coloration than other rails.	obsr195764	Elisa	Enders	S11004436	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	480	8.047		8	1		1	1

Heard and listened to for a few minutes without seeing at first. Only about ten feet away at the base of some marsh shrubs just at the edge of the salt marsh lining Big Creek on the inland side of the road. Sound was a semi-regular series of clicking "tack" notes, like two halves of a beak clacking together. Eventually the bird popped out and flushed across the road. I was able to see the head, back, wings and feet, but not the underside. Flight was fluttery and rail-like. Not powerful or particularly fast. The disproportionately large feet trailed behind the short tail in flight. The wings had a disheveled appearance, which I believe was due to the pale wing panels in the inner primaries and the white edges in the outer primaries. Otherwise the outer primaries were a chestnut brown. The back was a darkish brown with lighter mottling. I wasn't able to pick out the colors well. The crown of the head and nape were darker than the face, which was a tawny yellowish, with a dark eye set in a darker swath. The overall effect of the face was like a backwards "e" in dark brown over a paler background. The beak was thick and conical like a Sora's in build. Overall, the bird was similar to a Sora, but more compact, noticeably smaller, and gave the appearance of being maybe 1/2-2/3 the mass. ----I compared the sounds I had heard to recordings from Cornell's Master Set of bird sounds, and visually matched what I had seen to the illustration of an adult Yellow Rail in flight in the National Geographic field guide.----Contact calls suggest an adult male. Apparently these calls are not often heard apart from on breeding grounds, so this is particularly unusual if this bird is simply a very early migrant.----I received several stares from passerbys while birding here, and there are several no trespassing signs in the area. I stayed on the public road.	obsr334536	Oliver	Burton	S14815505	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	60	.966		1	1		1	1

I typically stop every 0.5 mile in favorable habitat and listen for 1-5 min. For this survey, I started 1 mile west of the intersection of Washington Street and CR 11. I went north 1 mile, then west for 7 miles. Then I started about 1 mile north of Middle Grove Lutheran Church and went west for 8 miles. Next, I went 5 miles north on CR 3 (starting about 1 mile north of Mekinock), then east 2 miles, then along the "bit ditch", ending up on CR 33, 1 mile east of its intersection with CR 3. Then I spot checked: the northeast corner of Mekinock WPA, 2 spots on the west side of the UND Natural History Area, and 2 spots south of the English Coulee Retention Dam.--    Time was from 11:30 PM to 4:30 AM on night of June 28/29. Full moon, virtually no wind, moon set at 4 AM by which time dawn was breaking. The hot area for Yellow Rails was the Prairie Chicken Management Area, and the intermingled private lands. --   To aid listening, I made considerable use of "bionic ear" which works quite well on quiet nights.  I made a total of 45 stops. With regard to mileage, I didn''t count miles when I was traveling from one area to another.--	This is a minimal number heard as it is impossible to tell how many are clicking when there are multiple birds clicking. Recorded at 12 of 45 stops. See notes.	obsr51867	David	Lambeth	S2996537	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	300	64.372		1	1		1	1

The site was UND's Oakville Prairie field station where I heard Yellow Rails in Aug of 1993 when I was with others at the UND observatory. That triggered a longterm interest in Yellow Rails that has resulted in learning that they can be rather common along the 30-mile long belt of saline grasslands.	obsr51867	David	Lambeth	S6562874	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD	5			1	0		1	0

Stopped every 1/2 mile and got out of the car to listen, using the parabolic reflector to hear better. A total of 30 stops were made. Last stop made about 5 AM, which is earlier than BBS routes begin! Tried to keep track of species heard at each stop without estimating numbers of each species. So the data is being reported as the number of stops out of 30. It obviously is quite a good year for Yellow Rail, Le Conte''s Sparrow, and Sedge Wren.	Heard on 14 of 30 stops. Likely more than one bird calling at a few of the stops.	obsr51867	David	Lambeth	S6571775	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	160	27.358		1	1		1	1

During each short flight, the rail revealed squarish white patches on the secondaries, contrasting with the darker wings. Immature Sora (Porzana carolina) was considered but has white trailing edges rather than the square patches described and illustrated in the sketches supplied with the written report. The observer described a descending cackling-like call heard at least twice-quite different from the more familiar clicking call of Yellow Rail. However, several literature sources were presented that describe a similar descending cackle from captive Yellow Rails.--		obsr90875	NYSARC	Data	S2087559	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD					0		1	1

Another pre-ebird backlogged report, which is why I am entering on 2/4/13.	***Report accepted by NYSARC (New York State Avian Records Committee)----NYSARC RECORD # 2011-93-A----Went to follow up on the reported Say's Phoebe from the following day. I arrived shortly before first light and walked out toward the meadow. Lighting was dim but getting brighter quickly. I traversed toward the center of the recently mowed meadow checking perches for the phoebe. All of a sudden, a small rail flushed up from 2-3 feet in front of me, flew about 40 feet and dropped back into a dense patch of grasses and forbes. The bird stayed within 2 feet of the ground during flight. I knew it was a rail, but what kind? I found a dead Virgina Rail in the meadow that I manage at the nearby Uplands Farm Preserve and wondered if this was the species that just flushed in front of me. Curious, I had to try again. I carefully walked to where I saw the bird land. Again, within 2-3 feet of me a small rail flushed, this time I paid close attention. The small rail exhibited obvious white secondaries, brighter and more prominent than a juvenile Sora would possess. I also noticed that the bird had a stubby bill, unlike the more elongated version of a Virginia Rail's. I began to realize that I had a Yellow Rail. Again, I attempted to get another view. Same procedure as before, the bird flushed in front of me and I noted the same field marks as the previous looks. This was the last that I would see of this bird. I quickly realized that I had come here for the Say's Phoebe, looked up, and it was perching on a U-post some 100 feet from me. I went back to searching for the Yellow Rail but came up empty. I even solicited help from some birders, who eventually showed up looking for the phoebe. Yellow Rails are rarely seen in daylight. This bird never did land out in the open. It always chose to disappear within dense, "pushed over" grasses and forbes that were created with the brush mower. The lighting was dim during my encounter, but just enough to gather a fair amount of detail. I should say, it was just enough light/darkness to see a Yellow Rail, as this bird would have been a lot harder to find if the sun were above the horizon. Yellow Rails, more so than others, are known to shun daylight and rarely are seen in the open.	obsr180937	Derek	Rogers	S12849747	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	90	1.609		1	0		1	1

I only saw the rail for a second or two but was able to observe some features of the bird. It was very small much smaller than a sora, plump body, long legs, the back had a dark and light pattern the light seemed more yellow then tan or light brown, and it was very fast. I saw it run into a small patch of reeds, to get out it had to go in the water or run back at us so it was trapped. --After some waiting Ben was able to see the bird, this is a summary of his notes:-- --Small rail, size of a baby chick.--Head had a dark brown cap. Streak through eye/cheek was dark.trailed onto side of the neck. A yellowish supercilium was over the eye.--Throat and breast looked speckled and splotched.--In flight small sparrow sized and pale (beige) with dangling feet.--Ruled out juvenile sora by small size and eye/cheek streak.	obsr295794	Cory "Chia"	Chiappone	S15299363	eBird - Exhaustive Area Count	EBIRD	91		4.0469	3	1		1	1

I refound the bird at 1st light the next day; my view was brief but diagnostic. The bird was less than 3' off the boardwalk and crossed an open area in the cattails so I was looking pretty nearly straight down on the bird and quickly noticed the rail was strikingly smaller than the Soras which were also in the marsh and the back was in full view since the rail was walking with its body virtually parallel to the ground, not upright. The back showed striking yellow and black stripes and there was no noticeable tail. One other birder had a brief glimpse this 2nd day. I was asked to not announce the sighting due to the sensitivity of the small habitat and the sensitivity of the bird.	obsr92825	kent	miller	S15307606	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	230	.805		1	1		1	1

After looking at LeConte's Sparrows, I was heading back to my car when I flushed one directly in front of me out of the tall grass. I was able to get my binoculars on the bird right away and watch it for a few seconds before it dropped back down in the grass. Boldly yellow and black streaked back and distinct white wing patches. Definitely not a Sora.	obsr119608	Ethan	Kistler	S11631468	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD				1	0		1	1

On Sunday we birded Red Slough, with the main event being a yellow rail rope drag.  It was quite an experience.  Very tiring walking behind the rope to try to flush rails.  We actually flushed YERA, SORA, LCSP, and other sparrows.   <br />Submitted from BirdLog NA for iOS, version 1.7.1	David Arbor and Berlin Heck conducted a Yellow rail rope drag with the group, and we were successful in flushing a Yellow Rail.

Stayed in Texarkana the night before, then drove back home after the Rail drag.	We had great luck, and flushed 5 birds (multiple times) out of the 2 fields we tried. The last bird gave us great looks as it froze right at our feet. I had to back up 10 feet to be able to focus on it with my lens. ----http://www.pbase.com/mctodd/red_slough_trip	obsr163792	Michael	Todd	S5462582	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	420	8.047		20	1		1	1

Parked right off Hwy and walked back into the marsh area.  Heard Soras, Bitterns and Rails as walked in.  All wore irragation type boots to slosh thru the marsh.  Marty got down low started ticking two rocks together and soon we heard the Yellow Rails responding back with their own ticking.  One came out and all got a super great look at it!!  Very small and a tiny yellow bill!  It stayed at Marty''s feet for about 30 seconds and then swam back into the vegetation.  Fantastic!  We then walked further into the marsh to another spot where he continued to tick the rocks together.  We heard more rails but only Letty got a brief glimpse of another Yellow.  We figure about 12 heard and two seen.  Target Bird and all got to see it!!  		obsr134134	Cheryl	Huizinga	S8321277	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	120	1.609		7	1		1	1

Currently, one of only six YERAs accepted by the Pennsylvania Ornithological Records Committee (PORC; Class III). Found alongside Jarrod Derr and Adam Stuckert in an overgrown field just across Bishop Rd (and, unfortunately, in private property) from Messiah College's Back 40 (acres). We stumbled across the bird while returning to campus in the late evening and watched it run mouse-like through the vegetation for a number of minutes at &lt;10'. Eventually, we succeeded at flushing it (once surrounded), which allowed us to see the white secondaries in flight. Including historical records, this is the earliest Pennsylvania YERA on record. It was not re-found the following morning.	obsr57052	Cameron	Rutt	S14989923	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD					0		1	1

Mostly cloudy with only rare sunlight. Temps 60 °F to 64 °F, winds S at 10 mph with gusts to 15 mph. Rain and lightening at about 3:30 PM chased us back to the car just when we were really beginning to find some birds.	This bird was heard but not seen in an area known for sparrows -- a grassy, but muddy field with low-lying areas with water.   I heard a series of 5 clicks (like the sound of an old-fashioned typewriter) and then one of my group asked if I had heard it?  I asked him to be specific and he said, the series of clicks that sound like an old typewriter.  I said yes.  Then, while he birded the muddy field, I stayed on the road.  Another companion and I heard the bird 2 more times over the space of 10 minutes.  When the first companion returned from the field, we pointed to the area where we had heard the bird.  He played the call of the Yellow Rail.  What we had heard earlier sounded like the recording.  We heard a clicking sound again once in response to the recording but it was from a distance.  Either the bird we had heard had moved away or did not respond to the recording.  A fourth companion, who did not hear the call,  stated he did not believe that Yellow Rails called in the winter.  When I returned home, I confirmed with Peterson's' that infrequent calls may be heard in the winter.	obsr49603	Catherine	Miller	S9650159	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	200	7.145		12	1	G344111	1	1

He gave us a rope and jugs and directions. We got to the spot and I knew it would not work as Candy was not tall enough to walk and pull the rope at the same town. We went to High Island and found a young couple who were big enough and  were eager to work. -- So we struck off pulling the jugged rope through the marsh. After about 30 minutes of not flushing the birds Candy asked what they looked like. I told her and she said that she had seen several small birds with white in the wing jump over the rope. Me and the young couple were watching for them to fly out in front of us and once we started watching the rope we got good looks at several birds.	obsr28523	John	Hintermister	S11249150	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD				2	1		1	0

We started out by flushing up a few sedge wrens and sharp-tailed sparrows, then a Sora, but not long afterwards we flushed up what was either 1 yellow rail 3 times or two yellow rails. We then headed off towards "deeper water" to look for Virgina Rails but with no luck. As we returned we came upon another Yellow Rail. Flushed it twice. All 5 looks at the rails were super close and very good. We ran the fence line for Black Rails, but didn''t find any. During the rail walk there were about 10 people. On the way back to the visitor''s center we heard then scared up a King Rail. After the rail walk I walked the Willows. In a recently plowed field near here were the upland sandpipers with some whimbrels.

Birded with Keith McMullen. Some birds observed were same as at other areas during the trip, but only reporting new birds for the trip.  Participated in the Yellow Rail Walk led by a volunteer with the Houston Audubon Society.	Great close-up looks from about 5 feet away as the group surrounded the bird and it flew up and out of our small circle.	obsr299758	Craig	Litteken	S14577456	eBird - Casual Observation	EBIRD				15	0		1	0

Small elongated bird viewed from top side only. Very yellowish with some white cross hatching on mantle giving to a pleated look. Very short bill and tail. A sedge wren was observed in the near vicinity and it was clearly bigger then the sedge wren and almost appeared tailless when compared to the tail length on the sedge wren. Sora was ruled out due to it appearing grayish with a proportionally loner tail.

After hearing the ticking I waited a little while and then played my Yellow Rail tape and the bird responded with the same ticking sound as the tape.  I called up Dan Belter and he drove up and heard it as well.	obsr110810	Mary	Backus	S12563492	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD	60			2	0		1	1

We were both doing the bird count for the IMBD, and I was at the Mead SWA when she called me at 9 a.m., so I stopped where I was at, and drove the 40 minute drive to meet her at this spot. As I was driving along, I thought how strange it might be to hear this bird calling at this time of day? I thought they were more active at night, but maybe they call during day light hours just as Sora's do? When I arrived, Mary and her birding friend were there, and they said the bird called a few times just before I arrived. We waited for only a few minutes when the rail gave its "tic-tic, tic-tic-tic" call several times, then went silent for 5 or so minutes before it called again. It was only 20 feet away from the road (and us), and we could clearly hear this distinctive call, like two pebbles being tapped together. We played the call/song once from an ipod player, and the song the rail gave matched exactly as to what we played on the ipod. Right after we played the ipod, the rail started to "tic-tic" again, but from a different spot in this grassy area. Hearing this bird so close to us, we tried the best we could to spot it moving around in the grass, but we never did see it. I will return at dusk to see if I can hear it again, and check the area over for possibly more of them.	Clearly heard the distinctive calling, "tic-tic, tic-tic-tic", from only 20 feet away! See the comments section where I wrote more on this report.	obsr151037	Dan	Belter	S10725250	eBird - Stationary Count	EBIRD_WI	25			3	0		1	1

Back was very dark brownish and black as well as the crown, and nape.  Only seen primarily dorsally with some of the side of the lighter face seen with a blackish smudge "spot" in the face. Very small rail easily much smaller than a Virginia or Sora which I've seen walking in park and marsh areas before.  Only got  a 2-5 second view as it flew down the trail and into the vegetation of the prairie.  I was unable to locate the rail with Lurie Garden personnel 10 minutes later.  Unmistakeable due to small diminuative size for a rail and two white secondaries.	obsr18154	David	Johnson	S15356281	eBird - Traveling Count	EBIRD	60	.161		1	1		1	1
